# FastAPI: This is the main FastAPI app class used to create your API.

# CORSMiddleware: Middleware to handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing). 
# It's needed when your frontend (e.g., React running on localhost:3000) tries to make requests 
# to your backend (localhost:8000).

# router as agentic_router: Youâ€™re importing a router (likely where your API routes/endpoints are defined) 
# from a file called agentic_routes.py in the routes folder, and giving it the alias agentic_router.
